<h3 class="headline">Who we are?</h3><span class="line" style="margin-bottom:30px;"></span><div class="clearfix"></div>
	<p><span class="dropcap">C</span>ELTAB is a development center for free and open-source software, it began with an agreement between the Itaipu Technological Park (www.pti.org.br) and Itaipu Dam (www.itaipu.gov.br).</p>
	<p>CELTAB is also a group of research and development in computational basis and essence is the use and improvement of tools and skills, under free and open licenses.</p>
	<p>We also have among our researchers, qualified personnel to communicate fully in the following languages: Portuguese, English, Spanish, German, Arabic and Guarani.</p>
<p>The development of free and open technologies in Latin America will, from now on, an important ally. Itaipu and Itaipu Technological Park (PTI) inaugurated the Latin American Center for Open Technologies (Celtab) arising on the proposal to be a center for research and development of innovative solutions that exclusively uses free technologies.
</p>
<p>PTI installed, Celtab has an investment of R$ 4.7 million for the next five years. Initially meet the demands of technology Itaipu, PTI and the Triple Border region (Argentina, Brazil and Paraguay). Subsequently, the solutions developed at the Center will be shared with the rest of Latin America.
</p>
<p>Celtab's proposal to create a network of collaborative development. "The focus is not on producing software, but research into new technologies. In this first phase, the protagonists are Itaipu and the PTI, but we are looking to partner with universities in the region and in the future, the Center will be open to other companies wishing to invest in open technology R & D".
</p>
<p>The center has eight investigators, two analysts and a consultant who is working in six research projects, four defendants by Itaipu and two by the PTI. One is the Biotelemetry project, which is developing a new technology based on open for automated control of the fish tagged with sensors that pass through the Channel Picema standards. "This technology will replace the obsolete model owner and now serves in part to the needs of Itaipu and several energy companies that perform the marking of fish".
</p>
<p>In addition to encouraging and funding scientific research of open technologies, the expectation is that in the future, the R & D Center developed to generate new business for the region. "We want to attract participants aware of the innovative entrepreneurship, the PTI Entrepreneurship program, evaluating new model based business incubator feasibility of open technologies".
</p>
<p><h3><span class="highlight color">Training</span></h3>
</p>
<p>The rapprochement with universities in the region is also a center of the strategy. The goal is to bring the academic environment for the software development processes of free base. For example, concepts about how communities organize and develop free applications will be presented.
</p>
<p>"It is also a desire of Celtab present the development of solutions based on open source collaborative development as it is much closer to the principles of computer science than many can imagine." The use of the concept of collaborative development, Celtab want to present a very different development paradigm creating proprietary software processes.
</p>
<p>The main open-source software developed in the world and the largest in number of lines of programming is the Linux kernel (with LibreOffice software as the second most lines of code) does not follow a methodology Whatever. It is built in collaboration. And how not follow absolutely no software development methodology can be well done and show that low error rate? This is a question that the software industry can not respond, let alone understand.
</p>
<p><h3><span class="highlight color">Free technology and its benefits</span></h3>
</p>
<p>Free and open technologies are those that can be used, copied, studied, modified and redistributed without restriction. They follow a development model based on distribution, since the solution is made available for the community to use and improve it. Thus, a series of collaborative development that benefits all involved with the project and users of the solution is created.
</p>
<p>In addition to encouraging the exchange of knowledge, adoption and investment in open technologies are also a strategic option for progress and technological field, therefore, to be free, a solution can be used and improved without depending on your license provider. "This exchange of ideas and research is the basis of science and generates a synergistic process of creation and innovation. We believe that the secrets and patents only delay the development of knowledge".
</p>
<p><h3><span class="highlight color">Free software at Itaipu and PTI</span></h3>
</p>
<p>The use of software and free software development in Itaipu completed in 2013, 10 years. In the framework of this program, the Latin American Free Software Conference was created (Latinoware), which today is one of the biggest events of free software in Latin America. There have also been deployed more than 20 open source solutions in the IT structure of Itaipu, which meet various business needs.
</p>
<p>The PTI is also an example in the use of free software in the corporate environment. Currently, 100% of the infrastructure of e-mail services, authentication, domain control, file servers, telephony and network management is in free software. In addition, programs and projects are also working on the development of open technologies such as the International Centre for Hydro-informatics (CIH), who created several open source based GIS systems.
</p>
<p>"With the creation of Celtab we are taking a step further and create a framework for research, development and improvement of open technologies. We create innovative solutions and improve existing ones to meet the demands of the Itaipu and PTI make them available to the Latino community".</p>
